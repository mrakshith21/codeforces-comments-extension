# Codeforces Comment Filter and Preview Extension



- View previews of comments sorted based on 
  * usefulness of the comment thread
  * comment writer rating
  * newest / oldest
- create a list of your favourite users and find out their comments in the blog
- view your comments in the blog
- View comments by the tutorial author (he might be explaining some problems)
- Display all youtube links (or maybe other links also, again maybe based on usefulness)


## More things

- View sub threads in a thread similarly (should come as a drop down). Should implement this for one level for now
- View comments by the tutorial author (he might be explaining some problems)

## Design plans

- Make the div transparent when user is reading / scrolling through the blog
- Close button
- Keep the width / menu fixed or find other ways to resize the div
- menu for different options
- Spinner

## Long terem goals

Mostly using AI

- Classify comments based on which problem they are talking about
- Generate summary of comments



## Things to store

- favourite authors
