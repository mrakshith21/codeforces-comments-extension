How to give a score for each comment regarding its relevance to a problem?

Things to make use of?
- Problem code - 'A', 'B' (also 'problem A')
- Problem name - each word
- tags

Phrases
- A, B, C, .. - problem codes (uppercase only)
- problem A, problem B, ...
- problem name - each word
- for A, for B ...
- of A, of B ...
- A's solution, B's solutions....
- in A, in B,
- use all prepositions before problem code
- 


Things to keep in mind:
- Split by space, as well as commas, !, and so on
- Remove inner tags in text (such as bold, italics, etc.)


Will be good to add
- Key words from the problem statement
- Key words from the editorial solution
- 


Possible ideas:
1. Give weights to above parameters and find weighted sum
2. Do the process for all comments in a thread before deciding
